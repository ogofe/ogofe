# 👋 Welcome To My Github 👋


## About Me
I'm Joel, a Computer Science major at the Air Force Institute of Technology, Nigeria.
I'm a Fullstack Developer with 4+ years of active development experience, I've written articles, given talks, and taught students about web technologies and building software.
When I'm not writing code or debugging, I write articles on Programming and Tech on Medium and other blogs, I'm also a publisher for the Medium publication - Javascript In plain English, and my articles and guides have helped over 15k+ devs in their web development journey and sits on the first page of Google search results. Being a Technical Writer and a Fullstack dev has connected me with people and opportunities that I never thought I'd achieve, and while I took a break from writing on Medium I've worked on some interesting projects, tinkered with new technologies and even old ones, built a canvas editing tool with Vue.JS and Fabric.js, built a Loom clone with WebRTC, played around with Web3 and ethers.js and picked up Java as a new language 😅.

I'm proudly Nigerian 🇳🇬.
